## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned that working through the mobile version first was best practice.
- I learned about to use elements of flex and the CSS grid together.

### Continued development

- I am still not completely comfortable with the CSS grid and the shortcuts. I struggled with figuring out how to place the sections and gaps along the centerline approriately.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout) - This MDN page was foundational for my learning.
- [Youtube Grid](https://www.youtube.com/@slayingthedragon) - This youtube channel helped me to understand the fundementals.
